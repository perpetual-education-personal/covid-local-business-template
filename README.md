# covid-local-business-template

A simple webpage template to help businesses craft a clear message during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is just a page for informational purposes. If you have a complex online store, then call whoever built it - *but* if you have a simple site / or a WordPress site *that isn't meeting your goals* / this might be better for the time being.

A companion to this https://perpetual.education/content-strategy-and-covid-19/ article.

Some of the files are prefixed with  `covid-` so that they wont interfere with any files already on your system.

## To put it in place

Have someone with a little experience - go in and change the HTML and add content for your business. Maybe fool around with the colors a bit.

They'll need access to your server. There's likely already an `index.html` or `index.php` file in there. They'll need to rename that file something like `index-pre-covid.php` or something / and then you can drop the new files in there - without overwriting anything.
